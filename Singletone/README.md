##The Singletone Pattern 


_Yes, I know, I know... A module in python is like a singletone, it's only instanciated once
 but it is a good exercecise to do a decorator class on python, isn't it? so... why not._ :octopus:

This Pattern ensures a class has only one
instance, and provides a global point of access to it.
